# The double-descent curve

This repository was created as part of the seminar _Generalization and Optimization in Deep Learning_ led by Thomas Frerix
during the winter semester 2019/2020 at the TU Munich.

The goal is to reproduce the results of the findings of the paper _Reconciling modern machine learning practices with the classical bias-variance tradeoff_ by Mikhail et al at Ohio State.
